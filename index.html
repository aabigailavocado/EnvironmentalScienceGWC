    <p> Every year, millions of tons of plastics end up in our oceans and into the bellies of fish. If no action is taken, the plastic will have a nonstop impact on our health, ecosystem, and communities.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>What We Stand For</h3>
<p> Pieces of microplastics, styrofoam, bags, utensils, and water bottles that possess a short span of convienence remain floating in the oceans. Because of this, Ocean Aware's purpose is to spread awareness on the effects of plastic in the ocean, and how society can cut back from using plastics and switch to alternatives.</p>
